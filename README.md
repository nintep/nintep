## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with an interest in game development and UX.

- I currently work at Nokia in 5G physical layer software.
- I'm about to complete my master's degree in Game Design and Development at Aalto University.

### Projects

- [Oja - Level Editor](https://github.com/nintep/oja-level-editor) is a grid-based level editor for a personal puzzle game project. It was made with Godot and C#.
- [Nonogram Editor](https://github.com/nintep/nonogram-editor) is a tool for creating nonogram puzzles. I built it using C++, CMake, and Qt.
- [Ambidextrous Snake](https://github.com/nintep/ambidextrous-snake) is a small project I created for testing how to set up CI for Unity projects with GitHub actions.
- [QA-service](https://github.com/nintep/QA-service) is a fullstack question-answer application created with various tools such as Docker Compose, Astro and Svelte.
- Games I've worked on are listed in my [game portfolio](https://nintep.github.io/)
